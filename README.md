# Hangman-Mini
As the name suggests, this is a mini version of the original Hangman game built using Python3. Those who have already played the game would be knowing about the rules and procedure already. But still.. here i provide some basic guidelines for the noobs.
You would be provided with the length of the word you need to guess, and one after the other you need to guess a character in that word (special provisions are made if you have recognised the word before completely, in that case you can type the whole word). INVALID ENTRY would be displayed if you enter more than one character or not the full word at a time. 
All Suggestions to improve this game are open.
Happy playing! Best of Luck
